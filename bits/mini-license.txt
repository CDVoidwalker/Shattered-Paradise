The custom assets that I (Nolt) have made were done only for use on the Shattered Paradise mod,
tho I know there is nothing stopping you for claiming them besides my disgust, if you have the
desire to take one or two of the units, let me know and I will probably allow you to, but please
do not make your own mod around them claiming that they are your creations, that would be quite
dissapointing. I encourage you to create your own assets instead, it's not that hard these times
and also it's quite rewarding. If you try to post these assets as if they were yours and somebody
of the community finds out well... your fraud won't last long.

If you have the desire to learn 3d modelling, I don't mind teaching the little I know, as long 
as you are using 3dsmax of course, I don't have experience in any other program.
