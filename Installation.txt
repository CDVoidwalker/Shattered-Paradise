This mod will likely not run on the current ORA bleed version, first because it may be outdated
and second because it uses custom code that requires some work to install into the latest bleed.
Therefore I recomend you to follow these steps.

1) Download the archive of the branch: https://github.com/ABrandau/OpenRA/tree/sp-engine
2) Download the archive of the branch: https://github.com/ABrandau/OpenRA.Mods.AS/tree/Bleed
3) Extract the contents of the OpenRA repository somewhere. 
4) place the AS logics folder inside the OpenRA repository, all their files must be on a folder named 
OpenRA.Mods.AS, which should be located in the openra folder.
5) Paste the mod on the mods folder located inside the OpenRA folder.
6) open make.cmd, type dependencies, wait until the process is comeplete and close.
7) open make.cmd again, type all, wait unit the process is complete and close.
8) the game and mod should be playable now.
